#### Editing Content

How about editing the content of your new Docsify site on GitHub Pages? View the Markdown page you want to edit (for example, **README.md**) and tap the **Pencil Icon**, then save any changes by tapping the green **Commit changes...** button. In just a few moments the Docsify site will be automatically updated to reflect those changes.

### Viewing Locally 
Run `npx serve .` (Node.js users) or `python -m http.server 8000` (Python users) in the repo folder to serve run locally.
